``` This project was developed as a part of Visual analytics project at Dalhousie University. This web based tool developed using Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Machine Learning algorithm. This tool will predict the Wines based on the selected taste, color, flavor, fragrance, type of fruit and <any other custom input>.    

How to run:

Option 1: you can directly execute python file named "topWines.py" inside the Visual_Analytics folder using command "python topWines.py" or "<python 3.0+ version> topWines.py". Finally, open the URL displayed on the terminal.  
If you find any exception on command prompt/terminal then install that particular package using "pip install <package name>".

Option 2: Open the project in PyCharm and run the main file.
